<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div>I was hired to find as many security and privacy problems as I can for the heroku app "guarded-plains-17517" built by Tomo Iwasaki. The app "guarded-plains-17517" was a car calling service similar to Uber. </div>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<div>I used postman to post testing data to the app.</div>

<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
<div>The app has multiple XSS vulnerabilities. The most obvious one is listed below with more detail. The app also has a design malfunction: when vehicle is posted, the app returns the vehicle list instead of passenger list as it should. It also appears that the app takes in and stores bad data such as invalid latitude and longitude, and sometimes undefined id. </div>
