The purpose of this git repository is: 
1. practice using HTML and CSS
2. practice both client and server side web programming through a project similar to Uber
3. build up a demonstration for future use

My favorite assignments are assignment 2 and 3. Combined they are a working system. They provided me with hands-on experience about web programming. 

I have grown a lot since day 1 of COMP 20 to now. 

The most important thing I learnt in this class is that never to trust user input. 
Assignment 4 and countless examples on the xss section of reddit are both evidences. 

In the future, I would like to learn more about programming skills related to embedding systems and robotics. 
I would love to dive deeper into cyber security, machine learning and artificial intelligence as well.
